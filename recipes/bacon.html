<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
This is a recipe for bacon. It may not be the best bacon but it will do the job.
<br>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5 pounds pork belly, skin on</li>
    <li> 1/4 cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pink curing salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup honey (preferably chestnut honey)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons smoked sweet paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the pork belly and pat dry. Transfer to a resealable 2-gallon plastic bag. To make the spice rub, mix the kosher salt, pink salt, brown sugar, honey, red pepper flakes, paprika and cumin in a bowl. Coat the pork belly all over with the mixture.</li>
    <li>Close the bag and refrigerate 7 to 10 days, flipping once a day, until the pork belly feels firm. It should take 7 days for a thin belly that is about 11/2 inches thick, longer for a belly that's 2 to 3 inches thick.</li>
    <li>Remove the pork belly from the bag, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Refrigerate the belly on a rack, uncovered, 48 hours.</li>
    <li>Set up your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions using applewood chips, and set to 200 degrees F. Smoke the pork belly 3 hours, or until the bacon reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Remove the rind (optional), then slice and cook as desired. To store, wrap the bacon in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1 week or freeze up to 2 months.</li>
    <li>Pink curing salt is a mix of salt and sodium nitrite. It keeps the meat pink and protects it from bacteria. You can find it at specialty food stores or online.</li>
